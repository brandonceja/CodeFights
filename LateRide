  Late Ride:

  One night you go for a ride in your motorcycle. At 00:00 you start 
  your engine which has a counter of how many time it has been working.
  When you want to get back to your home, you think that maybe the bridges
  to get to your home are up.
  
  You don't have a watch so you have to calculate what time is it only with 
  your motorcycle timer.

  The timer gives you the minutes that have passed you have to put it in format of hours:minutes 00:00 
  and you have to sume each digit of that format so you can calculate the actual time.

  for example:
  
  n=240
  lateRide(n) = 4
  
  since 240 is equal to 04:00 and 0 + 4 + 0 + 0 = 4
*/

int lateRide(int n)
{
    int hours, minutes, digits;
    hours = n/60;
    minutes = n%60;
    
    digits = hours/10 + hours%10 + minutes/10 + minutes%10;
    
    return digits;
}
