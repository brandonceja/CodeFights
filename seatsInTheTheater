    Seats in the theater:
    
    You're supossed to be in a theater, but you didn't like the performance
    so you want to leave and the exit is one row behind you to your left.
    The problem is that you are very shy and you don't want to block the view 
    for the other people. Given the total number of columns and rows, and the
    row and column where you are, you want to calculate for how many people are
    you obstructing the view
    
    for example:
    
    nCols  = 16 , nRows = 11 , col = 5 , row = 3
    seatsInTheater(nCols, nRows, col, row) = 96
    
    As there are 96 people behind and at the left of you.
*/

int seatsInTheater(int nCols, int nRows, int col, int row)
{
    int behind, left;
    behind = nCols - col +1;
    left = nRows-row;
    
    return left * behind;       //It is not a slipknot reference XD
}
