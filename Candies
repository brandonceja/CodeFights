/*
    Candies:
    n number of children have got m pieces of candies
    They have to divide them in such way that everyone eats the same
    And your goal is to determine how many candies will be eaten.
    
    for example:
  
    n = 3 and m = 10
    candies(n,m) = 9
  
    Because each kid eats 3 candies and there are 3 kids
    that's 9 candies and one remaining

int candies(int n, int m) 
{
    return (m/n) * n;
}
